## ⚠️ Before Starting
- Please remember to check the norm by using Norminette! Norminette can also be
  executed at the root directory to check every single subdirectory.
- Check your function names, one typo may cost you a lot of points.
- Only use the `main()` function if specified. You can still leave it (commented out)
  for testing.
- All the explanations of the exercises are in the exercise folders.
