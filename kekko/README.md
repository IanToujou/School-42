## ‚úÖ Exercise Completion

Open the root folder of an exercise to see more information.

Some exercises will have explanations or other useful stuff in readme files. Scroll
down to the bottom inside an exercise to see if there is any explanation available.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è More Information

You can, of course, just copy and paste all the code, but that won't work. Maybe
you'll get accepted, maybe not. I highly advise you to understand your code and try
it out yourself, before looking at any code in this repository. Struggling and failing
is and will always be a part of your journey, not matter if in the Piscine or in life.

I knew nothing about C before starting the Piscine, even though I have some programming
experience. Even with that experience, things were quite though and your main
objective should be to not drown in the Piscine, and submit some projects.

## üö® Help Needed

If you wish to support this project, by submitting uncompleted exercises, writing
documentation or writing explications, you can either open an issue on GitHub, or
contact me via Discord on my profile! Any help will be appreciated.

Also, if any of the projects is outdated, which means the `subject.pdf` file changed,
contact me.
